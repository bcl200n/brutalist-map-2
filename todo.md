- Connect contact form with db or use Netlify forms or same form provider as portfolio.

Sitewide

- Fix deploy to netlify, not working atm - netlify cli/setup as new project

- change github repo name to brutalist-map-2

- compare to brutalist map, when better switch url and describe change in github, move that one to public archive status and link to this github repo.
