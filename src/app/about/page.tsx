          <p className="text-xl">
            Brutalism is an architectural style that emerged in the
            1950s. It is characterized by its use of raw, unfinished
            concrete, bold geometric shapes, and an expressive design
            approach. The term "brutalism" originates from Le
            Corbusier's phrase in French : "b√©ton brut," which means
            "raw concrete."

          <p className="text-xl">
            London has some of the best examples of Brutalism in the
            world. After World War II, a group of idealists began to
            rebuild the city in concrete. What remain are some of the
            most striking civic and housing buildings ever built.
